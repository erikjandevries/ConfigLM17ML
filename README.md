# Config Linux Mint 17 for Machine Learning
This is a script for setting up and configuring a fresh installation of Linux Mint 17.1 for Machine Learning.
It installs a bunch of packages, and I might add other features as I go along...

## How to start
The quickest way to start is:

    sudo apt-get install -y curl
    curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erikjandevries/ConfigLM17ML/master/ConfigLM17ML > configlm17ml
    . configlm17ml
