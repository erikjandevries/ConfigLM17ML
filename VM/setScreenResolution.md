# Set Screen Resolution

If by default the 1920x1080 screen resolution is not enabled, you can use the shell script

> setScreenResolution.sh

to automatically set the screen resolution at login.

Copy the file to your home directory, set the execution permissions:

> chmod 755 setScreenResolution.sh

and add the script to the Startup Applications.
